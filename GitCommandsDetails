Three states in GIT are Modified, Staged and commited.
Working directory, Staging Area, .git directory -> 
-----------------------------------------------
If we make changes to the files in the working directory, we call the files are in modified state.
If we move the files from working directory to Staging Area, we call the modified files are in  staging area (or) staged.
When we commit the files, the files are moved from Staging area to .git directory (i.e. files are commited in .git). 
Index or Staging area is tracked inside .git directory.


git config --global user.name <user_name>
git config --global user.email <email_address>

(This command above can we rewritten i.e. changed to
another user/email by issuing the same command)

Git stores snapshots of your work (i.e. git staging area).
But how does git know whose work it is storing? from the 
global 'user.name' and 'user.email'.

.git directory - Where the configuration files, git repository
information, snapshots of the folder {in which git init is done}.

git diff - Displays the changes that needs to be staged w.r.to. what is the git. once we
stages the changes. git diff output is clean.
git diff  (working dir vs staging dir)
git diff --staged ( staging vs git)

Add & Commit -
----------------
git init - It converts a folder into working directory. I.e. add a .git directory
and adds additional info inside the directory for tracking.
initializes a empty git repository.

git commit -am "message" 

Tracked file vs UnTracked file - We can use the .gitignore to specify the 
files in the local working directory to be tracked by git.

Untracked files - The files that are not added to the git staging area.

git add . --dry-run -> List the files that move to the staging area.
